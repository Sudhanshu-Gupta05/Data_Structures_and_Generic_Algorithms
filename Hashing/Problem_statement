Given a binary tree, your task is to complete the function verticalOrder which takes one argument the root of the binary tree and prints the node of the binary tree in vertical order .

          1
       /     \
     2       3
   /        /
4       5

The nodes of the above tree printed in vertical order will be
4
2
1 5
3
Your output should be 4 $2 $1 5 $3 $

Note: Each vertical line will be separated by a "$" without quotes.

Input:

The task is to complete the method which takes one argument, root of Binary Tree. There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

Output:
The function should print nodes in vertical order where  each vertical line is separated by a "$" without quotes.

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 30
1 <= Number of nodes<= 20
 

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2 R 1 3 L
4
10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R

Output:
3 $1 $2 $
40 $20 $10 60 $30 $


There are two test cases.  First case represents a tree with 3 nodes and 2 edges where root is 1, left child of 1 is 3 and right child of 1 is 2.   Second test case represents a tree with 4 edges and 5 nodes.

 

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given above are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
